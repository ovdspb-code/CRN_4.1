Main figures
- Graphical_Abstract_optional.png: High-level schematic across C. elegans / Drosophila / mouse proxy (user-provided).
- Figure1_TwoFactorMechanism.png: Two-Factor mechanism and DES profile (user-provided).
- Figure2_DES_across_scales.png: DES curves across substrates (user-provided).
- Figure3_Drosophila_architecture_dependence.png: Selectivity ratio-of-means vs ε at κ=0.001 (A) and κ=1.0 (B) (derived from the A8.6 postprocess outputs on your side).
- Figure4_Energy_objectives.png: A7 comparison plots for InfoPerCost (A) and Utility (B).

Supplementary figures
- FigS1–S4: P_good and coverage_end vs ε for κ=0.001 and κ=1.0.

Tables
- A7_compare_table.csv: summary table used for the energy-aware plots in Figure 4.

Note
Raw trialwise outputs for A8.5/A8.6 are large and live in your local run folders (A8_5_OUT_*, A8_6_OUT_*). 
This bundle contains only the manuscript-ready figures plus the compact A7 comparison table.
