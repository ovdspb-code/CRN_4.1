# Convenience copy of precomputed artifacts

This folder mirrors the precomputed outputs from:

- `../R12-CROWN/outputs/`
- `../R12-CROWN-LargeN-N1000/outputs/`

It exists only to make it easy to locate figures/CSVs/metadata in a single place.
The canonical, reproducible outputs are the ones generated by running the scripts in each package.
