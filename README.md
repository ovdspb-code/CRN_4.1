# CRN (Coherent Resonant Netting) — reproducibility repository
softvare DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18338260
This repository packages code + numeric backends (CSV) + figure assets used in the CRN core paper and Supplementary Materials.

Key principle: **GKSL/Lindblad open‑system dynamics is used here as a mechanistic proxy** for *transient wave‑like exploration* under dephasing/measurement. This does **not** require (and does not claim) microscopic quantum computation in neurons.

Repository contents cover three substrates + one companion study:
- **C. elegans** — touch circuit (small real subcircuit; stress/temperature sweep; energetic‑budget advantage regime)
- **Drosophila larva** — real connectome subsystem (DES peak + architecture dependence via rewiring/lesions)
- **Mouse cortex proxy** — cortical microcircuit proxy (permeability vs confinement; SBM hierarchical feed‑forward proxy)
- **Evolutionary game / selection** — companion dataset and scripts (strategy catalog, trade‑off boundary, replicator dynamics)

## Install (recommended: clean env)

Conda (safest):

```bash
conda create -n crn python=3.10 -y
conda activate crn
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r env/requirements.txt
```

If your base Anaconda has a broken package metadata (e.g., `pyodbc 4.0.0-unsupported`), do not upgrade pip in base. Create a clean env as above.

## What to run (minimal entry points)

1) **Drosophila (A7–A8 pipeline)**

See `experiments/drosophila/README.md`.

2) **Mouse cortex proxy + architecture trade‑off + evolutionary selection (Steps 2–6)**

```bash
cd experiments/step6_release_candidate/CRN_step6_release_candidate
python steps/step2_repro_bundle/CRN_step2_repro_bundle/step2_cortex_transport/run_cortex_transport.py
```

Other steps are documented inside that bundle’s README.

3) **C. elegans (touch circuit sweeps)**

```bash
python experiments/elegans_touch_circuit/crn_nematode_pipeline.py
```

The CSV backends generated by these sweeps are stored alongside the script in the same folder.

4) **Companion archive (evolutionary game selection study)**

Zenodo DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.18379851`.

A *public snapshot* of the same companion dataset is also vendored under:
- `datasets/zenodo_18379851_evolutionary_game/`

## Layout

- `manuscript/` — core paper + Supplementary Materials drafts
- `paper/` — final figure bundles (PNG/PDF) + digitized source data

- `experiments/` — runnable code and local outputs (Drosophila pipeline, connectome bridge scripts, step‑6 release bundle, C. elegans touch circuit)
- `datasets/` — companion data packages intended to be mirrored 1:1 with external DOI archives

- `data/` — derived CSV backends for figures/tables
- `env/` — Python dependencies
