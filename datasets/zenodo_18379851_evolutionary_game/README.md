# Zenodo companion dataset (10.5281/zenodo.18379851)

This folder is a *mirrored, convenience copy* of the public companion dataset archived on Zenodo:

**10.5281/zenodo.18379851** — “Evolutionary Game Theory Reveals Modular Specialization as a Universal Solution to Neural Trade‑offs”.

Recommended practice for the paper
- Cite the Zenodo DOI as the authoritative, frozen archive.
- Treat this GitHub copy as an index and as a human‑readable entry point.

Contents
- `PUBLIC/` — figure backends (CSV) and the corresponding scripts used to regenerate key panels (phase diagrams, strategy catalog, replicator‑dynamics example, etc.).
- `Zenodo-Checklist.md`, `Zenodo-Release.md` — internal release notes (kept for provenance).
- `Evolutionary Game Theory.md` — narrative description.

If you plan to keep this folder synchronized with Zenodo releases, enforce a single‑file payload on Zenodo (e.g., upload a single ZIP with this exact folder structure) to avoid “flat file dumps” in the Zenodo UI.
