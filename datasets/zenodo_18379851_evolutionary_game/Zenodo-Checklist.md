**Subject:** Priority Claim: Evolutionary Game Theory of Neural Modularity (Zenodo)

**Body:**
```
Dear [Colleagues/Lab Group],

I have published a priority claim for our evolutionary game theory results on neural modularity:

**Title:** Evolutionary Game Theory Reveals Modular Specialization as a Universal Solution to Neural Trade-offs

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX
**Date:** January 26, 2026
**URL:** https://zenodo.org/records/XXXXXXX

**Key Finding:** Modular architectures are evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) with +6-31% fitness advantage, achieving 99.86% population dominance within 71 generations.

**Data Included:**
- Full fitness landscape (90 strategies × 441 environments)
- Evolutionary dynamics (71 generations)
- Robustness validation (9 parameter sets)
- Causal control experiment

Full manuscript in preparation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
